# Social Manager

The primary aim of this project is to develop a Google Chrome extension aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of excessive usage of social networks among individuals on a daily basis. This extension will empower users to proactively block not only social networking platforms but also any other websites they wish to abstain from accessing. Consequently, whenever a user attempts to visit a blocked social network or webpage, the extension will prevent access, effectively impeding their navigation through the restricted content.

Here are some images of the extension:
